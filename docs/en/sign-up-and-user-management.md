Hello! Here we'll learn how to create a Botmaker account and manage operators of a bot.

## How to create a new account?

To create a new user account on Botmaker, you have to access the following link:
- https://go.botmaker.com

At the first access, you'll see three options for sign up. You can sign up with Google account, email account or Facebook profile.

Once the account has been created, the SuperAdmin will be able to grant you access to one or several bots under his domain.

>Let your SuperAdmin know your Botmaker account after you created one.

## Add users to the Bot
To add a new user to the Bot, a user with SuperAdmin profile should access Botmaker and follow the next steps:

1. Menu
2. Settings
3. User Roles

At user roles section, the SuperAdministrator should click the + button, at the bottom right corner.

A popup will show up. On it, there's a text box which the new users' email address should be put manually.  When done, click **"Add"**.

## The functions are:
- **Operator**: given to users whose tasks are referred to chat management.
- **Configurator**: given to users whose tasks are referred to chat management and general Bot configuration.

When finished inserting the user's function, click **"Save"**.

## Edit user roles
If it's needed to edit a function of a user already logged on the Bot, you need to find his profile.
