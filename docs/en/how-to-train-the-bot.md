# How to train the Bot?
 
Hello! Here we'll learn how to use the section **"Not understood"**. This section is essential to improve the bot comprehension of terms.

## Not understood terms
On this section, it's seen the terms that the Bot didn't understand. Each card groups examples that occur frequently and the artificial intelligence judges them as similar. See below:

When creating new rules, triggers, and answers based on these cards, you'll be able to improve the Bot's behavior.

>Tip: take a look at the page "How to create a rule?" in case you need some help doing the necessary changes.

When finished working on a card, you can remove it by clicking the **"Remove card"** button, allowing other cards to appear.
