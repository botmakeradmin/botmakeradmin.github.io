# Massive sending of content (Push)

Hello! Here we'll learn how to send content massively to a segmented audience.

Botmaker allows the creation of customized audience profiles for content sending, useful for:
- Sending ads
- Announcing new products and services 
- Realizing products and services surveys
- Announcing Bot's new features
- Requesting forms fills
- Offering subscriptions and news

## Possibilities
We can use the following variants and settings for massive sending of content through the platform:
- Audiences customized by attributes (genre, channel, preferences, etc.);
- Schedule date and hour of the push;
- Support for messages with media elements (videos, images, audios, GIFs, emojis, and files);
- Messages with menu options and buttons, for realizing surveys and obtaining user data by formulary.

## How to use?
1. Access the "Audiences" menu.

2. On this section, you'll be able to see the last scheduled messages and create new ones, too.

![Create](https://github.com/botmakeradmin/botmakeradmin.github.io/blob/master/docs/en/images/CreatePush.png)

>Note that you can, using the buttons, see metrics of a push, edit a push, duplicate it (generating a new one based on the actual), remover the push or deactivate it (it won't be sent when the scheduled date arrives).

3. To create a new push, click on "Create new". It will appear this window:

4. Editing a push
- You can name a Push editing it on the box "New message".
>The name is used only for identification on the platform, it won't be visible for users who will receive the notification.
- On "Audience", it will be defined which users are going to receive the message. You can segment your audience adding conditions, which only users tagged on them will receive the push.
>Note that as you add - or remove - conditions, the number of users that are going to be reached changes. If you desire to send the push to all users at once, while we don't recommend it, all conditions must be deleted.
- As your audience is defined, now you will schedule the date and hour that your message is going to be triggered.
- Now, for the final step, you'll define the content of the push. It can be:
    - A text: when adding a +Text, it'll be possible to write a text message.
    - An action: when adding a +Action, it'll be possible to trigger Bot's rules, script a form and/or attribute variables to the user.
    - A media: when adding a +Media, it'll be possible to send an image, audio, a video and/or a file.
5. After done the desired content configuration, click on "Save". When the scheduled time comes, the selected audience will receive the push!
